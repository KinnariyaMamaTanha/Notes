This is a recording of my study notes mainly in CS and AI, you can take whatever you want if you like it.

It has collected C++, python(partly), markdown and LaTex so far(mainly in Chinese, partially in English), maybe in the future it will be larger and greater, who knows?

Maybe, it will be the best gift for me in the future, when I look back to my past years.

To contact with me, e-mailing to the address 2823324228@qq.com is a good choice.

Anyway, nice to meet you, stranger but my friend, god bless you.

p.s.: 
Some errors still remain here. Therefore, I highly recommend you to clone this repository to your PC and open it as a vault in the Obsidian for I use the app to take notes(Another important reason is that there exists some Obsidian links in my notes. If not opened in Obsidian, the links between notes can't be seen). That might be a little troublesome. Thanks for your forgiveness.
